Howdy! This portfolio site was built using Next.js, Chakra UI, Three.js, and Framer-motion.

This was an excellent opportunity for me to brush up on my Next.js and React skills and was a great medium to express some creativity!

Most of the challenges revolved around rendering the Three.js canvas a react component that was responsive to all window sizes and still having it look nice.
